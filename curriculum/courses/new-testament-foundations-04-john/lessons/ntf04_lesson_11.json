      "text": "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love... This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends... You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide... If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you... If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you... But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. And you also will bear witness... I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away... They will put you out of the synagogues... when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth... He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you... Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice... your sorrow will turn into joy... I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world. When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you... since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent... Holy Father, keep them in your name... I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one... Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world... I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one... Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory... O righteous Father... I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.'"

By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.' He commanded, 'Love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.' Jesus warned, 'If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you...

He promised, 'When the Helper comes... the Spirit of truth... he will bear witness about me... he will guide you into all the truth... he will glorify me.' Jesus said, 'In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.' Then Jesus prayed: 'Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son...

He warns of persecution but promises the Holy Spirit's help. He then prays to the Father for Himself, the eleven disciples, and all future believers."

Obedience and love are inseparable. The world's hatred confirms disciples belong to Jesus, not the world. The Spirit testifies to Christ, empowers witness, and guides the church in truth. Jesus' prayer reveals His heart: glorify the Father, guard disciples from the evil one, sanctify them in truth, send them in mission, and unite believers across generations. Eternal life is relational knowledge of the Father and the Son."
