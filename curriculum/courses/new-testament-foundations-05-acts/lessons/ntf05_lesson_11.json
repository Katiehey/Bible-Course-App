False accusations led to a temple riot, and Roman soldiers arrested him. Paul addressed the crowd, recounting his conversion and commission from Jesus to the Gentiles. The crowd erupted, and he was taken into custody. Before the council, Paul declared he was on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead, dividing Pharisees and Sadducees. A plot formed to kill him, but Paul's nephew reported it. Roman authorities transferred Paul under heavy guard to Caesarea. That night the Lord stood by Paul and said, 'Take courage... you must bear witness also in Rome.'"},
