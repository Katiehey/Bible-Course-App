    {"segment_id":"reading","type":"reading","audio_script":"Listen to Acts 8 and 9. After Stephen's death, great persecution scattered the church, and those scattered preached the word. Philip proclaimed Christ in Samaria with joy and signs. Peter confronted Simon's false heart. An angel then sent Philip to a desert road where an Ethiopian official read Isaiah. Beginning with that Scripture, Philip told him the good news about Jesus. The official believed and was baptized. Meanwhile Saul sought to destroy the church. On the road to Damascus, a light from heaven flashed and a voice said, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' Saul asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' The answer came, 'I am Jesus.' Blinded, Saul was led into the city. The Lord sent Ananias to him, saying Saul was a chosen instrument. Saul was filled with the Spirit, baptized, and immediately proclaimed Jesus as the Son of God."},
