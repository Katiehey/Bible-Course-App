Paul defended the faith before governors Felix and Festus and before King Agrippa, insisting he proclaimed only what Moses and the prophets foretold: Messiah's suffering and resurrection. To avoid unjust transfer, Paul appealed to Caesar. On the voyage to Rome, a violent storm struck. Paul encouraged all aboard with God's promise that lives would be spared though the ship would be lost. They were shipwrecked on Malta, where Paul ministered with signs and healing. Finally arriving in Rome, Paul met Jewish leaders and explained the kingdom of God from Moses and the Prophets, persuading some while others disbelieved. Acts closes with Paul under house arrest, proclaiming Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance."},
