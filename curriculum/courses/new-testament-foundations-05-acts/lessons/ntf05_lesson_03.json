At the temple gate called Beautiful, Peter said to a lame man, 'In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.' Immediately he was healed and praised God. Peter preached that this happened by faith in Jesus, whom God raised from the dead. The priests and Sadducees arrested Peter and John, yet many believed. Before the council, Peter declared, 'There is salvation in no one else.' The leaders threatened them not to speak in Jesus' name. Peter and John replied, 'We cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.' The church prayed for boldness, and the place was shaken. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke God's word boldly, sharing possessions so none were in need."},
