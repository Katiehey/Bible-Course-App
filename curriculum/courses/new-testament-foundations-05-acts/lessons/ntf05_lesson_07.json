They preached in Cyprus and then in Pisidian Antioch, where Paul proclaimed Jesus as David's promised Savior raised from the dead. Many believed, especially Gentiles, but opposition grew. In Iconium and Lystra, God confirmed the word with signs. After healing a crippled man, crowds tried to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods, but they redirected glory to the living Creator. Soon opponents stoned Paul and left him for dead, yet he rose and continued. They revisited cities to strengthen disciples and appoint elders in every church."},
