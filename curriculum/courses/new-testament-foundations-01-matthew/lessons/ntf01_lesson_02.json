And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus."

And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, Out of Egypt I called my son."

Joseph's plan to divorce quietly shows his righteousness and compassion. The angel's message cites Isaiah 7:14 about the virgin birth. The name Jesus means Yahweh saves. Immanuel means God with us. Matthew emphasizes divine intervention at every stage. The flight to Egypt echoes Israel's exodus history. Jesus recapitulates Israel's story as the true Son.",

Each event demonstrates Jesus as the climax of Israel's story. The virgin birth reveals both Jesus' divinity and humanity. He is conceived by the Holy Spirit yet born of a woman. Joseph's obedience to the angel parallels Abraham's faith. Both men trust God's seemingly impossible promise.",

The virgin birth is essential to this identity. Only one who is fully God and fully man can save people from their sins. Matthew presents Jesus as the ultimate answer to Israel's longing for God's presence. The name Jesus declares his mission: salvation.",
